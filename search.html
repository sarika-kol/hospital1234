        <h2 class="display-5 fw-bold">History</h2>
        <p class="lead text-start">Indigenous populations had been affected by various diseases brought by European settlers and missionaries, including tuberculosis, smallpox, measles, mumps, diphtheria, typhoid, and influenza, from the 19th century onwards.[6] These exposures to new diseases reduced the population by as much as 90%. At best, waves of infection are partially documented. Tuberculosis moved more slowly, but by 1950, one in five Inuit were infected.[6] Mortality rates in the 1930s and 1940s rose higher than 700 people per 100,000.[7]

Early hospitals for First Nations were mostly church-run, in a manner similar to the Indian residential schools. For example, the Grey Nuns opened a small hospital on the Blood reserve in southern Alberta in 1893 with the support of the Department of Indian Affairs, while the Anglican Church of Canada founded a hospital on the nearby Blackfoot reserve in 1896.[8] Other "Indian annexes" (or "Indian wards" or "wings") were provided for segregated medical care, such as in the basements of hospitals for settler populations.[7]

Slowly, the Department of Indian Affairs took control of the hospitals away from the churches. The Blood hospital was replaced with a new structure paid for by the department in 1928, and the Blackfoot hospital was replaced in 1923, partially with funds taken from the band's trust fund.[8]

Government officials' request for the legal backing to forcibly remove Inuit and other Indigenous people from their communities is documented as far back as 1920.[9] An amendment to the Indian Act was passed in 1927 to this effect..</p>

 Indian has been used in keeping with page name guidelines because of the historical nature of the page and the precision of the name similar to Canadian Indian residential school system.[1] The use of the name also provides relevant context about the era in which the system was established, specifically one in which Indigenous peoples in Canada were homogeneously referred to as Indians rather than by language that distinguishes First Nations, Inuit and Métis peoples..[1] Use of Indian is limited throughout the page to proper nouns and references to government legislation..
